    <p id="p_lg2_4yb_tbc">Once a project is open, an additional stripe is displayed below the top
      stripe with an <uicontrol>Open Workspace</uicontrol> button that creates a workspace branch
      starting from the latest version on the "main" branch. If a workspace is already creating,
      invoking the button opens the already existing workspace.</p>
    <p id="p_w3v_jzb_tbc">When a workspace is open, the left stripe contains the following
      navigation options:<ul id="ul_r1y_nzb_tbc">
        <li id="li_s1y_nzb_tbc"><uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> - Displays the file tree of the current
          project. You can expand or collapse folders similar to any common file browser. Click on a
          file to open it in the visual editor. To add a folder to the workspace, click the 3
          vertical dots next to the parent folder. To delete a file from the workspace, click the 3
          vertical dots next to the particular file and select <uicontrol>Delete
          file</uicontrol>.</li>
