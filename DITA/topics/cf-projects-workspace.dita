    <p id="p_lg2_4yb_tbc">Once a project is open, an additional stripe is displayed below the top
      stripe with an <uicontrol>Open Workspace</uicontrol> button that creates a workspace branch
      starting from the latest version on the "main" branch. If a workspace is already creating,
      invoking the button opens the already existing workspace.</p>
    <p id="p_w3v_jzb_tbc">When a workspace is open, the left stripe contains navigation options to
      open the <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Publications</uicontrol>, or
        <uicontrol>Changes</uicontrol> side-views.</p>

      <p id="p_hcj_frz_vbc">The <uicontrol>Files</uicontrol> view displays the file tree of the
        workspace. You can expand or collapse folders similar to any common file browser. Click on a
        file to open it in the visual editor. To add a folder to the workspace, click the 3 vertical
        dots next to the parent folder. To delete a file from the workspace, click the 3 vertical
        dots next to the particular file and select <uicontrol>Delete file</uicontrol>.</p>

      <title>Publications View</title>
      <p id="p_xkq_hrz_vbc">The <uicontrol>Publications</uicontrol> view displays the map of a
        publication in a tree editor. Use the drop-down control in the side-pane to select a defined
        publication. You can click the <uicontrol><image href="../img/CF-OpenEditor16.png"/>Open in
          editor</uicontrol> button to open the DITA map defined in the particular publication in a
        tree editor that is displayed in the main visual editing area. You can click on a file
        displayed in the side-pane to open it in the visual editor (or double-click a file when the
        map is open in the tree editor).</p>

      <p id="p_xwv_jrz_vbc">The <uicontrol>Changes</uicontrol> view displays all the files that have
        been changed in the workspace.</p>
      <p id="p_ncf_trz_vbc">You can click on a file to see a comparison (diff) of the changes. The
        version on the left shows the current workspace version while the version on the right shows
        the current project version.</p>
      <p id="p_pww_5rz_vbc">A contextual menu can be invoked by clicking the 3 vertical dots
        (ellipsis) next to a particular file when hovering over it and the following actions are
          available:<ul id="ul_cvw_fsz_vbc">
          <li id="li_dvw_fsz_vbc"><uicontrol>Open file</uicontrol> - Opens the latest editable
            workspace version of the file in the editor.</li>
          <li id="li_ys5_hsz_vbc"><uicontrol>Discard changes</uicontrol> - Discards any changes you
            have made to the file in the workspace.</li>
