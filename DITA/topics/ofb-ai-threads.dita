    <body>
        <p>The AI Threads page displays initial messages from users that interact with the AI
      Assistant. Users can interact with an AI Assistant on the current site, and as an admin, you
      will be able to filter and review these messages. <xref href="ofb-team-management.dita">Users
        with an <i>Owner</i>, <i>Admin</i>, or <i>Moderator</i> role</xref> have access to this
      page.</p>
    <p>There are several options for filtering the threads:<ul id="ul_byy_csx_mdc">
        <li>You can click one of the thread status filter buttons to search for threads with a
          specific status (<b>Useful, Not Useful, Invalidated, All</b>).</li>
        <li>You can use the drop-down menus next to the status filter buttons to search for comments
          for a specific version or time frame.</li>
        <li>You can use the text field to search for specific content.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>To review an individual thread:</p>
    <ol id="ol_ahc_nsx_mdc">
      <li>Locate the message from the list.</li>
      <li>Click on the "View Thread" button next to the message to access the full conversation with
        the AI Assistant.</li>
      <li>Review the full context of the user's interaction and provide appropriate responses or
        actions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>On the right side of each message, you'll find indicators that describe the assessment of the
      message:</p>
    <ul id="ul_vgm_psx_mdc">
      <li><b>Useful</b>: This tag indicates that the message was considered helpful or
        informative.</li>
      <li><b>Not Useful</b>: This tag is assigned to messages deemed unhelpful or irrelevant.</li>
      <li><b>Invalidated</b>: Messages marked as invalidated may contain inaccurate information or
        not pertain to the content.</li>
    </ul>
