    <p id="p_qjy_jks_fdc">The <i>Samples</i> plugin is a collection of various types of documents
      used to showcase the product's features.</p>
    <p id="p_rjy_jks_fdc">By default, the plugin is included in the kit, and it does not have access
      control.</p>

        >disable this plugin</xref> in production environments.</p>
