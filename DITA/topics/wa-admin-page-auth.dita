  <title>Administration Page Authentication</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_hgs_hmv_kdc">The <uicontrol>Administration</uicontrol> page provides access to critical
      configurations, such as security settings, and allows for uploading frameworks and plugins.
      Due to the sensitivity of these actions, access is limited to users with the <i>admin</i>
      role.</p>
    <p id="p_igs_hmv_kdc">As a general best practice, avoid sharing the administrator account among
      multiple users and limit administrator privileges to only a few individuals.</p>
    <p id="p_jgs_hmv_kdc">By default, the application allows the administrator to access the
        <uicontrol>Administration</uicontrol> page using a username and password stored within the
      application. However, you can also configure authentication via an external service, such as
        <xref href="wa-login-admin-active-directory.dita">Active Directory</xref> or OpenID Connect
      (OIDC).</p>
