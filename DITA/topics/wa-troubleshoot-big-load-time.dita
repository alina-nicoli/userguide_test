      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>The browser freezes with the loading widget spinning indefinitely when opening a document
        (or it takes too long to open).</p>

        <title>Cause</title>
        <p>There are a lot of reasons that can lead to a slow loading time (e.g. slow internet
          connection, bad customization that interferes with the document load process, large sized
          documents, etc).</p>
      </cause>
      <remedy id="solution1">
        <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p>In the most cases, the slow loading time is caused by a customization (a plugin or
            framework, or a custom option). In this case, it is recommended to try to reproduce the
            problem without any customizations.</p>

          <p>In some cases, the problem can be solved by updating to the latest version to see if
            the problem is reproduced in the latest version.</p>

          <p id="p_x21_fcs_1dc">Sometimes documents load slowly because of the time it takes to
            compute styles. This increases linearly with the size of the document and the size of
            the CSS rules. The CSS rules are mainly contributed by the framework. The styles are
            computed when loading both server-side and client-side.</p>

          <p id="p_aqd_1ds_1dc">Sometimes documents load slowly even if the main opened document is
            small, because it references many other documents that get expanded by either

              <xmlatt>conkeyref</xmlatt> attributes.</p>
          <p id="p_bqd_1ds_1dc">For each referenced document that gets expanded, the application
            makes a request to an external server to retrieve the document content, thus the network
            speed and latency between the Web Author server and the server from where documents are
            retrieved is critical.</p>
